# json parser

C++ implementation of a (almost spec-compliant) json parser, written to learn
more about both C++ and parsers.  Don't ever even think about using this in a
real project, it's just a learning experience for me.

## Building

*Requirements:*
- gcc 9.3+
- GNU make
- conan
- linux

*Building*

1.  First install dependendencies:

- `make install`

2. Then compile the application:

- `make {debug|release}`

Executables for your architecture can be found at
`./build/{release|debug}/search`.

The makefile is human-written, and not generated by a disgusting makefile
generator, so it should be fairly readable without a lost of documentation.

*Compilation Database*

You can generate a compilation database for the application, suitable for many
editors, by running `bear make`.  For more information, refer to the [bear
documentation](https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear).

## Benchmarking

This is implementation is _not fast_.  But it's still around 2+x faster than
either Node.js or Python, at least with some basic tests.  Play around with
./scripts/bench.sh to see; I haven't done any "real" benchmarks where I spend
lots of time trying to make sure the languages are on a perfect playing field
though.
